## Initial RStudio Set Up Steps
I will be including these, but with the # comment indicator. 

--- 

### Step 1

First, I install the packages via the RStudio console. 

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("here")
```

Next, I download the file from Github using the RStudio console.
```{r}
# download.file(
#  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/r-socialsci/main/episodes/data/SAFI_clean.csv",
#  "data/SAFI_clean.csv", mode = "wb"
#  )
```
